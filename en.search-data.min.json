Explore how an automated vehicle might be guided along a road or track and how line detection could be used to save lives. Design ways to improve driving safety by helping to prevent drivers from falling asleep and causing an accident.\nTask Description    You will need to complete all the following sections as part of your collaborative presentation:\n  Drive and stop at a line\n Design a flowchart for the automated vehicle to stop at a line. Working code with comments Validation video    Following the line\n Design a flowchart for the automated, driverless vehicle to follow a line. Working code with comments Validation video Explain how an automated vehicle might be guided along a road or track. Once the wheeled robot is following the line, can it be improved to behave more like a car (i.e., move in a straight line rather than a wiggle)?    Line Detection\n To simulate what could happen if a driver falls asleep while driving, your robot could sound an alarm signal when it crosses the line. Program your robot to perform this function. Add you working code with comments. What can happen if a driver falls asleep while driving? How can we detect when a driver is falling asleep? How could you improve your program?    Extension\nSimulate a vehicle’s behaviour at traffic lights by having their wheeled robot respond to a series of green and red signals. Placing their code inside a loop allows for the possibility of multiple “traffic lights” along a track. Use the technic beams available in the EV3 core set to simulate green and red lights. Place the beams on the table so the Color Sensor can detect them while rolling over them.\n  To Be Successful     Appropriate protocols when taking a photos/videos of others.

A project folder is a directory/folder on your computer that contains the main program (main.py) and other optional scripts or files. This project folder and all of its contents will be copied to the EV3 Brick, where the main program will be run.\nThis page shows you how to create such a project and how to transfer it to the EV3 Brick.\n Figure 8: A project contains a program called main.py and optional resources like sounds or MicroPython modules.   Creating a new project    To create a new project, open the EV3 MicroPython tab and click create a new project, as shown in Figure 9. Enter a project name in the text field that appears and press Enter. When prompted, choose a location for this program and confirm by clicking choose folder.\n Figure 9: Creating a new project. This example is called getting_started, but you can choose any name.   When you create a new project, it already includes a file called main.py. To see its contents and to modify it, open it from the file browser as shown in Figure 10. This is where you’ll write your programs.\nIf you are new to MicroPython programming, we recommend that you keep the existing code in place and add your code to it.\n Figure 10: Opening the default main.py program.   Opening an existing project    To open a project you created previously, click File and click Open Folder, as shown in Figure 11. Next, navigate to your previously created project folder and click OK. You can also open your recently used projects using the Open Recent menu option.\n Figure 11: Opening a previously created project.   Connecting to the EV3 Brick with Visual Studio Code    To be able to transfer your code to the EV3 Brick, you’ll first need to connect the EV3 Brick to your computer with the mini-USB cable and configure the connection with Visual Studio Code. To do so:\n Turn the EV3 Brick on Connect the EV3 Brick to your computer with the mini-USB cable Configure the USB connection as shown in Figure 12.   Figure 12: Configuring the USB connection between the computer and the EV3 Brick   Downloading and running a program    You can press the F5 key to run the program. Alternatively, you can start it manually by going to the debug tab and clicking the green start arrow, as shown in Figure 13.\nWhen the program starts, a pop-up toolbar allows you to stop the program if necessary. You can also stop the program at any time using the back button on the EV3 Brick.\nIf your program produces any output with the print command, this is shown in the output window.\n Figure 13: Running a program   Expanding the example program    Now that you’ve run the basic code template, you can expand the program to make a motor move. First, attach a Large Motor to Port B on the EV3 Brick, as shown in Figure 14.\n Figure 14: The EV3 Brick with a Large Motor attached to port B.   Next, edit main.py to make it look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env pybricks-micropython from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick from pybricks.ev3devices import Motor from pybricks.parameters import Port # Create your objects here # Initialize the EV3 Brick. ev3 = EV3Brick() # Initialize a motor at port B. test_motor = Motor(Port.B) # Write your program here # Play a sound. ev3.speaker.beep() # Run the motor up to 500 degrees per second. To a target angle of 90 degrees. test_motor.run_target(500, 90) # Play another beep sound. ev3.speaker.beep(frequency=1000, duration=500) This program makes your robot beep, rotate the motor, and beep again with a higher pitched tone. Run the program to make sure that it works as expected.\nManaging files on the EV3 Brick    After you’ve downloaded a project to the EV3 Brick, you can run, delete, or back up programs stored on it using the device browser as shown in Figure 15.\n Figure 15: Using the EV3 device browser to manage files on your EV3 Brick   "},{"id":13,"href":"/dit8/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/tankGame/","title":"Tanks","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":" Battle City 1985 Tank Moving the tank Background and Walls Randomizing the Walls Blocking Movements Tank Cannon Destroying Walls One Enemy Enemy Bullets Many Enemies Winning and Losing  "},{"id":14,"href":"/dit8/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/","title":"Walk-throughs","parent":"Game Design","content":""},{"id":15,"href":"/dit8/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/chaseGame/","title":"Chase game","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":"Chase game\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/dit8/robotics/gettingStarted/structure/","title":"Structure of program","parent":"Getting Started","content":"For obscure, historical reasons, the first line must look exactly like this.

The sequence of a program is extremely important as once these are translated, carrying out instructions in the wrong order leads to a program performing incorrectly.\nThe following example code will execute each line in order/sequence\n1 2 3 4  print(\u0026#34;Let\u0026#39;s introduce ourselves.\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;My name is Eliza. What is your name?\u0026#34;) name = input() print(\u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34; + name + \u0026#34;, nice to meet you.\u0026#34;)  \r Sequence in a Flowchart     Sequence in a flowchart      Selection    IF statements    Selection is a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met. In programming, there are often occasions when a decision needs to be made. Selection is the process of making a decision. The result of the decision can either be TRUE or FALSE, this determines which path the program will take next.\nThe following code uses selection to test the condition varHeight \u0026gt; 1.6, if this condition is TRUE then \u0026ldquo;Tall enough to enter ride\u0026rdquo; is printed.\n1 2  if varHeight \u0026gt; 1.6: print(\u0026#34;Tall enough to enter ride\u0026#34;)  \rThe following code uses selection to test the condition username == \u0026ldquo;Callum\u0026rdquo;, if this condition is TRUE then \u0026ldquo;Access granted\u0026rdquo; is printed. If the condition is FASLE we can use else: to execute a different line of code.\n1 2 3 4  if username == \u0026#34;Callum\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Access granted\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;Unknown username\u0026#34;)  \r Selection in a Flowchart    In flowcharts we us a diamond shape to represent a question or test condition that can be TRUE or FALSE.\n Selection in a flowchart      Iteration or Loop    Programs often need to repeat certain steps while or until a condition has been met. This process is known as iteration.\nIteration or repetition is often referred to as looping, since the program ‘loops’ back to an earlier line of code.\nIteration allows programmers to simplify a program and make it more efficient. Instead of writing out the same lines of code again and again(mistages happen), a programmer can write a section of code once, and ask the program to execute the same line repeatedly until no longer needed.\n"},{"id":26,"href":"/dit8/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/verticalShooter/","title":"Vertical shooter","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":" Twin Bee  "},{"id":27,"href":"/dit8/robotics/assessments/","title":"Assessment tasks","parent":"Robotics","content":""},{"id":28,"href":"/dit8/robotics/gettingStarted/baseCode/","title":"Starter code","parent":"Getting Started","content":"This is a good base to use at the top of each of your projects.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  #!/usr/bin/env pybricks-micropython  from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick from pybricks.ev3devices import Motor from pybricks.parameters import Port, Stop from pybricks.robotics import DriveBase from pybricks.tools import wait from pybricks.ev3devices import (Motor, TouchSensor, ColorSensor, InfraredSensor, UltrasonicSensor, GyroSensor) # Initialize the EV3 Brick.  ev3 = EV3Brick() \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Setting up motors and sensors ------------------ It is vital that you correctly tell the EV3 what sensors it will need and where they are connected.
