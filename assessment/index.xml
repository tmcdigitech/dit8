Would you like to make one yourself? In this project, youâ€™ll build an animal quiz. Even though the questions are about animals, this project can be easily modified to be about any other topic.

The code in grey is existing code; use this to work out where to add the new lines of code.</description></item><item><title>2: My First 2D Game</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit8/assessment/first2Dgame/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit8/assessment/first2Dgame/</guid><description>Using the examples worked through in class, you will need to develop the game to have the following features working:
