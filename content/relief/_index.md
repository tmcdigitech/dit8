Your next assessment task is a partially developed game, with the features listed on [the task page]({{< ref "/assessment/first2Dgame" >}}). The examples and challenges on these pages will get you most of the way there:
- [Drawing graphics]({{< ref "/gameDesign/02basics/graphics" >}})
- [Arcade games]({{< ref "/gameDesign/02basics/arcade" >}})

You can also use the videos in the [Basic game walkthrough]({{< ref "/gameDesign/02basics/basicGameWalkthrough" >}}), particularly for displaying text on the screen.
