By <span style="color: #50fa7b;">**Thursday Week 5**</span>, your video game should include the following features:

1. <span style="color: #ff79c6;">**Individual Actor Sprites**</span> - the game should use your own choice of pictures
2. <span style="color: #ff79c6;">**Collectibles**</span> - there should be an item the player collects (e.g gems in gemcatcher)
3. <span style="color: #ff79c6;">**Collision events**</span> - what happens when your player crashes into walls, collectibles and other characters
4. <span style="color: #ff79c6;">**Active scoreboard**</span> - show the current score on screen and update in real time
5. <span style="color: #ff79c6;">**Internal comments**</span> - Use comments to explain what your code is doing.
```
# This is a comment. Good programs have these.
