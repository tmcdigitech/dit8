title: "R6: Obstacle Course"
weight: 3
---

**In teams of two**, you will design algorithms using flowcharts to create an automated, driverless vehicle that can navigate an obstacle course. You will then adapt your code to use a touch sensor and an ultrasonic sensor to complete the same course, and make comparisons between the solutions.

This challenge features a sequence of turns that the robot must perform in order to get to the "end" of the course. The robot must begin at the starting point and get to the goal area by completing turning and forward movement behaviours. The robot must *not* cross any lines.

You will need to complete all the following sections as part of your collaborative presentation:

## 1. Traverse course with no sensors
- Working code with comments
- Validation video

## 2. Wall detection with touch sensor
- Design a flowchart for the automated, driverless vehicle to reach the goal using a touch sensor.
- Working code with comments.
- Validation video

## 3. Wall detection with ultrasonic sensor
- Design a flowchart for the automated, driverless vehicle to reach the goal using an ultrasonic sensor.
- Working code with comments
- Validation video

## 4. Connection to our world
1. What differences were there between the touch and ultrasonic sensors in relation to your code and the driverless vehicle? Explain.
2. How do modern vehicles use these two sensors?

# To Be Successful
- Use appropriate protocols when taking photos/videos of others.
- Acknowledge sources appropriately including source of graphics.
- Plan and implement consistent and logical navigation.
- Include hyperlinks to navigate the presentation.
- Reference sources appropriately.
- Complete all 3 sections of this task *including questions*.
- Work collaboratively with your partner.
