weight: 20
---

Using the examples worked through in class, you will need to develop the game to have the following features working:

- Player movement
- Collectables
- Score
- Collision Events
- Code with internal comments

## To Be Successful 
- Include all the above items in your game and complete by the due date.
- Include comments with all your Python code
- Use appropriate programming structures (selection and iteration)

## Purpose
Students will be guided through the programming skills and techniques required to complete their final Game Design Project. At the checkpoint students must demonstrate their first 2D Game meets all the requirements.Students will further develop their coding skills by developing a program that uses modules, selection, iteration and variables.
